# PlayGround
Repository for small projects which would not suit an own repository. 
Here I test some constructs or try to write good code.

You can find the following content (packages are bold):

**Math**
* ApproximationOfPi: Calculating Pi with BigDecimal and more than 16-digits given by Math.PI
* Factorial: Computes the factorial of a given number n, even for high numbers.
* Greatest Common Divisor: Class for finding the greatest common divisor manually without using BigInteger.gcd().
