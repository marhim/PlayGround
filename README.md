# PlayGround
Repository for small projects which would not suit an own repository. 
Here I test some constructs or try to write good code.

You can find the following content (packages are bold):

**Math**
* Factorial: Computes the factorial of a given number n, even for high numbers.

**Senet**

In my first semester studying for my bachelor's degree, 
I had to write my first console based game in Java.  In this package I will rewrite 
[Senet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senet "Senet on Wikipedia") in a much cleaner fashion.
